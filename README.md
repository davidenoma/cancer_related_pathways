## Data aggregation from cancer pathway databases 

Using API calls and downloaded gene sets, I have been able to curate the gene and pathways associated with cancer from each of the databases, namely: 

1.	KEGG  

2.	Migsdb  

3.	Netpath  

4.	Pathway commons  

5.	Reactome
  
6.	WikiPathways

## Tools used include: 

## Outcomes
This code can obtain pathways and genes associated with all types of cancer. 
Depending on the researcher's need, the genes and pathway associations may be used for downstream analysis and processing.
